# Ginkgoch Map for Node.js
`Ginkgoch MAP` is GIS Full-Stack Solution with JavaScript. It is a development library for building map visualization, data analysis on web service/application, desktop and mobile. It is not necessary to learn the other programming languages, but build your maps with JavaScript only.

## Features
1. Full-stack GIS (backend/frontend) development with JavaScript only - Learn one programming language and develope full-stack GIS solutions.
2. Visualization/Data analysis - A complete development framework with visualization libraries, data APIs.
3. Rapid APP development - Compatible with HTML5 layouts as well as many fantasic mapping client library to build responsive application prototypes with your own GIS data.
4. Performance and interactivity - Smoothly visualize millions of geometries on server and compatible with 3rd party client mapping libraries.
5. Scalability - Scale your apps to millions of requests with Ginkgoch-Server as a backend. In-app cluster is also supported.
6. Cross-platform - Web service, Desktop or Mobile; macOS, Linux or Windows; no native APIs.

## Getting Started
Here is a project to represents basic functions of Ginkgoch and build a very simple XYZ map tile service with KOA with your own data. https://github.com/ginkgoch/map-quick-started-demos


Due to the low level GIS library for Node.JS, you can also build:
1. Command line tools - https://github.com/ginkgoch/node-shapefile-cli
2. Desktop application - https://github.com/ginkgoch/node-shapefile-viewer
3. Map Service (Docker support as well) - https://github.com/ginkgoch/node-map-server
4. Mobile - WIP...

## Screenshots
TBD...

> `Ginkgoch map` uses `Cairo` as its render engine. Before using `ginkgoch map`, please refer [canvas' official guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) to quickly install its dependencies with command on your OS.
