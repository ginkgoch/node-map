# Release Note

## v1.12
* Add `ViewportUtils.getInitViewport` function to get a proper lng, lat, zoom from envelope
* Allow to build geometries with number arrays for easier number input. e.g. `new LineString([{x:0, y:0}, {x:10, y:10}])` becomes `LineString.fromNumbers([0, 0, 10, 10])`
* Implement query function on FeatureSource which allows to query features based on spatial relationship: `intersect`, `disjoint`, `within`, `overlap` and `touch`
* Add declare file (*.d.ts) for native register for better typescript support
* Fix a bug of a returning type is bind to another libâ€™s specific version, which makes typescript upstream project compile filed
* Add a strategy to auto break down values by its index position. Previously, it breaks down by value, when the maximum value is far away from the second large value, the effect is not good.
* Allow to create new delimited file with specified features.

## v1.11
* Add a set of APIs for building geometries with number arrays
* Add declare files for better compatible for Typescript

* Fix query disjoint features not support bug

## v1.10
